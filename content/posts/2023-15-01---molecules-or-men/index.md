Philosophy can be incredibly polarizing. People can cling to their pet hot takes with all the aggression and rationalization of political pundits. And as with dogshit political takes, these ideas are non-negotiable. All too often when people ask “do you believe in free will”, they aren’t looking for an engaging, rational debate. Rather, they’re identifying party lines and drafting up a sketch of your mind. Big questions like consciousness and free will, with all their glorious ambiguity and lack of foothold, lose standing as philosophical altogether. They become something more like ornaments, decided at random or to make a statement about one’s philosophical affiliation. Since no intellectual purchase can be found, we decide they’re adiaphora and argue them on impressions alone.  
I don't think free will is nearly as hard or deep a question as people make it out to be. I don’t think it has to be a question *at all*. Before I get to that, though, what makes someone take one side or the other? I claim that people’s mainly vibes-based opinions on such complex questions are explained by one main axis - reductionism. Whether they work top-down or bottom-up. If you work bottom up, you see the lowest level of abstraction first. It looks nothing like intelligent agents making choices and manipulating the world. Instead you see particles chaotically jumbling around. They organize into complex systems but it feels impossible that even such massive groupings of basic mechanical behavior could give rise to magics the likes of consciousness and free will. Starting down in the molecules leads to reductionist materialism and related philosophies, denying the special position of agents in the world and concluding that free will and consciousness are ultimately illusions. Start from the other end and something very different happens. If you instead consider what living intuitively feels like, it seems *obvious* that you have control over your own actions and the world. It’s perhaps less rigorous than materialism because complex systems are *complex* but it makes up for that in intuitive correctness. And so here we stand, divided by our starting points and arguing into the void about who’s right. Clearly one of the two stances is right and the explanatory gap between the two sides is just keeping the others from seeing that. If you could just explain your take well enough to the others, *certainly* they’d concede you were right all along.  
Or so too many people seem to think. Maybe not explicitly, but it’s there in the polite “so, do you think free will exists”s. The fruitless conversations about a question they seem to think matters. I disagree. I think it’s not a contradiction to answer “both yes and no”.  
No because everything reduces to a soup of particles evolving according to a mix of deterministic and nondeterministic rules. Neither of which is under your control, implying that “you” is more a passenger along for the ride on the surface of a roiling quantum sea. “You” is inside the system, and thus bound by it.  
Yes because this quantum sea is so mind-bogglingly information-dense and interconnected that to specify the whole system would require an infinite amount of information. To write down all the forces influencing you, you’d have to also consider how that literal *list of forces* affected you as well. Because in a quantum world, all wave functions are entangled and no change can be made anywhere without also affecting everything else. But then, after changing the list, you’d have to take into account how those *changes to the list* further affected the macroscopic wave function. And on and on. It’s impossible to embed an arbitrarily complex representation of reality inside of reality. And so, whether or not your actions are semi-deterministic evolutions of past information isn’t practically important. Saved by paradox. Then again, nothing is deterministic anyway. While I certainly don’t believe any quasi-spiritual fuckery is going on in quantum mechanics, inherently imbuing you with free will, it sure fucks over any delusions of determinism. The uncertainty principle and superposition mean that at least no one can ever *specify* the rules if they exist. *Quantum theory saves the day once again.*  
Ultimately, I think “does free will exist” is the wrong question. I think that a far more informative equivalent would be something like “is consciousness passive or active”. Is it an unimportant byproduct of the *actually important* mental processes, or is it something intentionally evolved or honed? Can it actively feed back into the body’s action loop or is it just a hapless passenger strapped onto the brain for no good reason. Given the incredible clarity and richness of consciousness, even though we have no idea how or why it works, it seems likely that it *is* active. That it figures in an important way into the body’s informational-state-evolution loop. Any other view smacks of dualism and seems to imply a kind of separate “mental realm” that we have no evidence for.  
In light of this, it seems *totally valid* to say that free will both does and does not exist. In the same way that a pointillist painting can be both a chaotic collection of dots and a beautiful cathedral, I think we can be *both* molecules and men. The former has the benefits of rigor and explanatory power, but becomes less useful in its microscopic scale. The latter, while less easily proven, is a much better policy to live your life by. I think that issue’s two tribes are just two very different kinds of people - one who looks first at the pragmatic, dead foundation and another that starts at the magnificent, somewhat illogical pinnacle. I think this example gives us a good case study for many other arguments. Oftentimes when you’re caught aimlessly arguing past someone, not covering any intellectual ground, it’s a matter of perspective. Your beliefs don’t feel like beliefs, they feel like the truth. And if you don’t realize that, it can seem like everyone around you has gone insane.  
Note: It kind of sounds like I pivoted this post halfway through, frankensteining what I could and leaving a cobbled mess behind, doesn’t it? Well, that’s because I did just that! I initially started this blog post to discuss a very abstract, confusing idea of how free will could meaningfully arise in even a fully deterministic world. But when it came time to actually explain it, I realized that I’m still far too confused to write coherently about it. For the curious, below is a quote from a conversation with a friend, where I tried as best I could to explain the virtue of trying in a deterministic world.   
> Something like "even if on a very high level of abstraction you're just the inevitable sum of particle interactions, you have preferences (which come from those interactions, but fuck it). There are some worlds you want to see and some you don't. So maybe if you take an action in line with those values, it was just the predictable result of the stuff that makes you. But worlds where you didn't take that action aren't optimal worlds to you. So you can sort of acausally influence the underlying reality by making this the world in which you were bound to do the action you wanted. If you do the action, then it was inevitable, and likewise if you don't, but doing it means that you're in the world where that was inevitable, and thus the world that satisfies your preferences. So even if you ultimately can't "control" the outcome, doing the thing you want means that this is the world in which you do that thing and are satisfied"

I know it sounds confused and contradictory, but I feel like there’s something good in that general part of idea-space. Since I needed to put this blog post out, I didn’t get a chance to look as hard as I’d like, but I’ll probably do just that over the next few days, and may write a follow-up to this.
