A while ago, a friend asked me something along the lines of "if you could beam a kilobyte of information straight into the minds of every person alive, what would it be?" Here's an attempt to write my (technically kibibyte).  
- Beliefs don't feel like beliefs. They feel like the way the world is.
- Your worldview isn't perfect. There are big things you're wrong about.
- AI risk goes much deeper than copyright and you losing your job.
- Evolution isn't just for animals. For example, only the most viral ideas survive - and the fact they're popular doesn't necessarily mean they're right.
- The future will be way weirder than you think.
- No one is the victim 100% of the time.
- You can do weird stuff to achieve your goals. You don't always have to do the default thing.
- It'd be very bad if the only known life in the universe suddenly disappeared.
- Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence. Ordinary claims shouldn't.
- Updating your beliefs isn't a sign of weakness.
- Lots of problems happen because everyone does the best thing *given* what everyone else is doing. If we all changed what we were doing at once, we'd fix the problem. But that never happens.
- Don't do stuff you aren't good at or don't enjoy. Wasted talent never helped anyone.
