Things often sound far worse than they actually are. Oftentimes, you’ll feel quite stupid to find the task you’ve been dreading all day isn’t intrinsically horrendous and that you wouldn’t actively prefer having your eyeballs removed by ravens to it. And yet that’s exactly how it felt looking at it. You made yourself suffer just *thinking* about the thing. I suffered listless, painful uncertainty all day because in my mind writing blog posts is supposed to be draining and boring and a chore. Ditto working out and cleaning and doing work. They all hurt to look at because they’re supposed to be unfun. They’re supposed to be hard work. But when you actually do them, they’re no such thing. I have no idea how certain tasks acquired this aura of supposed-to-be-painful-ness, but they certainly have it without reason. The moment you immerse yourself in most of the tasks you’ve been putting off, you’ll find they’re nothing.  
I guess the root solution to this problem is to stop fucking trusting what people say you shouldn’t enjoy. Because if I’ve learned anything looking at the way society operates, it’s that those people are *stupid*. I don’t think that activities themselves have the ability to be intrinsically pleasant or unpleasant. At least not within the everyday spectrum. I think that from within, doing math problems, taking a walk, and watching your favorite anime are similarly rewarding. That, once started, each’ll feel roughly as pleasant as the other. I think that the real differences emerge on the meta level. Some things are supposed to be painful and others leisurely. Some your brain remembers more fondly than others because of the sugary jets of neurochemicals they produce. But I don’t think that any of that really matters to your enjoyment inside of the tasks, only your appraisal from an outside view. I think your wanting-to-do-this-task meter is a matter of metadata, not hard conclusions about how enjoyable the task will be. I think that everything you do is more or less neutral-feeling while you’re doing it - only afterward does your brain determine whether or not it wants to do it again. This is one obvious solution to the apparent contradiction that lots of stuff *suuucks* when you think about doing it, but isn’t actually that painful once you get started. And so if you can push past the initial pain of starting the task and overriding your brain’s anti-pain biases, you’ll find you feel fine.  
Anyway, I’m probably talking in circles at this point. Sorry for the short and rather disorganized post, I’m quite sleep deprived (another topic for another time) right now. But I think that you can get rid of a lot of pain in your life by just doing the stuff that you really don’t want to. It sounds like it’ll ruin you, but I really doubt it. I think your brain is trying to pull a fast one on you, tricking you into not doing perfectly-find tasks. And if you always flinch away from doing the hard stuff (which, as stated, isn’t particularly hard anyway) you’ll accumulate a pile of regrets and avoidant procrastination. Which I’m sure will hurt *way* worse than the tiny initial pinprick of overcoming your brain’s imaginary pain-filter.
