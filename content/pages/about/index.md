HiðŸ‘‹! I'm Elijah. I think about things sometimes. Much more rarely do I write about them but I'm trying to change that because You Can Actually Change Things You Don't Like. I'm self-studying right now and kind of fascinated by everything. AI is cool but *darn, curse the gods* that I want to make the AI that ends the world way more than the one that saves it. I'll probably still go into alignment, so I'm currently working on building a bunch of AI architectures from scratch.
I was a 2023 atlas fellow, highly recommend rat camp. It feels like the talking to all of the fascinating, intelligent people at Atlas and indulging in the idea-heavy, think-about-whatever-is-cool-to-you atmosphere really woke me up for the first time in my life.
Hit me up for late-night conversations about random stoner-level topics like:
- The philosophical implications of AI
- Neuoscience
- Paleogenetics
- Dangerous/experimental biohacking
- How to Make Yourself Better
- Physics
- Qualia and the nature of consciousness
- Quantum/exotic computing
- Really anything else! If you think it's interesting, it probably is!
