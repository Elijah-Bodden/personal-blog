Hiüëã! I'm Elijah. I think about things. I almost never write about them, but I'm changing that. I'm self-studying right now and kind of fascinated by everything. AI is cool but *darn, curse the gods* that the AI that ends the world looks *way cooler* than the one that saves it.  
Alignment is cool too though. I'm currently puttering around trying to find out how to get into it and so far it's been really fun. Other areas I'm studying include physics (the Feynman lectures ‚ù§Ô∏è), linear algebra, topos theory and paleogenetics.
I was a 2023 atlas fellow, highly recommend rat camps. It feels like the talking to all of the fascinating, intelligent people at Atlas and indulging in the idea-heavy, think-about-whatever-is-cool-to-you atmosphere really woke me up for the first time in my life. Maybe I'll even write about it one of these daysü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
Hit me up for late-night conversations about random stoner-level topics like:
- The philosophical implications of AI
- Neuoscience
- Paleogenetics
- Dangerous/experimental biohacking
- How to Make Yourself Better
- Physics
- Qualia and the nature of consciousness
- Quantum/exotic computing
- Really anything else! If you think it's interesting, it probably is!
