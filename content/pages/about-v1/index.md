Hey! I'm Elijah, a rising junior from Houston, Texas (ðŸ¤ )

I'm fascinated by genetic engineering - in particular alternative biochemistries, synthetic lifeforms, and gene drive - and I'm currently researching in vivo GM because it's cool as hell.

Depending on AI timelines over the next two years, I'll either go into college for pure mathematics/q physics or jump straight into alignment in whatever capacity I can without college.

Like a lot of people, I've gotten really frustrated with the school system recently, b/c it inflexibly applies to the nonexistant average kid. Thanks to my state's loose homeschooling restrictions, next year I'm going to just go to the library every day and study whatever I want, and then say I'm homeschooling.

Also, MIT OCW is literal godsend if you're bored with whatever you're currently studying

Membrane (https://github.com/Elijah-Bodden/Membrane) - I logged over 600 hours last summer coding this fucker up. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the end result, but it was definitely not the best use of my time. At least I learned a lot about distributed systems and WebRTC, and proved to myself that I could write a decent peer bootstrapping algorithm from scratch.
