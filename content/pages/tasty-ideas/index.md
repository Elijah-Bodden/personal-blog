Here's are some cool random idea fragments I've collected to savor/write a blog post about in the future. It's mainly for my own convenience, but by all means jump on anything that catches your interest. Every idea in this list is amazingly fun to think about!  
<br>
1. Corvids are [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmJ3xuJrUcM), [*very*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerUbHmuY04) [intelligent](https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2011/02/02/corvid-savants/). Plus they can use human language. And breed fast. Could we make them superintelligent?  
2. DMT is the perfect psychedelic. It's unaddictive, doesn't seem to affect brain structure or chemistry long-term, strongly enhances creativity, and maybe gives direct access to the subconscious mind throguh hyper-intelligent "DMT entity" hallucinations.  
3. Related: The subconscious mind is unbelievably powerful. Basically every idea, decision, and solution you make is actually just subconscious thoughts bubbling to the surface. Your mind trusts your conscious mind very little to not fuck shit up, so most things you do are not intentional. Also, you can maybe tune the algorithms that decide what comes to the surface, which will maybe [make you either a genius or insane.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bbB4pvAQdpGrgGvXH/tuning-your-cognitive-strategies)  
4. You can get [*really* high by just breathing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BNejY1e9ik) Be warned, it [probably works by depriving your brain of oxygen and acidifying your blood](https://www.reddit.com/r/breathwork/comments/zskjfe/dangers_of_starving_brain_of_oxygen_during/), so maybe don't make a habit of it, but I definitely recommend trying it at least once.  
5. A [single neuropeptide called Orexin-A](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sksP9Lkv9wqaAhXsA/orexin-and-the-quest-for-more-waking-hours) *may\*\*\** be able to decrease your body's stress response - increasing your calorie consumption without making you gain weight, reducing your sleep need by 2-3 hours per night, increasing risk-taking behavior, reducing alzheimer's risk, and making you happier. Suffice it to say, strong claims require stronger evidence but this sounds pretty awesome.  
6. Taking caffeine every few days can *MASSIVELY* improve productivity and happiness without creating a tolerance.  
7. Gender imbalances in careers could *possibly\** be caused by [androgens' high level effects on people-oriented v.s. things-oriented interests](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/07/contra-grant-on-exaggerated-differences/). This could also explain the much higher incedence of autism in men.  
8. Idk, conlangs are very fun and you [can learn toki pona in 10 hours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm).  
9. If [quantum immortality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7RHv_MIIT0) is true, we could maybe build a machine connected to a quantum RNG that, like, nukes the shit out of society if the rng doesn't produce the correct solution to an NP problem. Then we get an oracle that magically always produces the correct answer in polynomial time. Because of some fucky time-delay stuff this is probably just a real-suicide machine/an always-make-random-quantum-tunnelings-in-the-detection-apparatus-give-false-positives machine. But it would be cool if it worked.  
10. [Music probably evolved for group-coordination/trolling the shit out of predators.](https://meltingasphalt.com/music-in-human-evolution/)  
11. Religion is a meme and is selected for maximal virality.  
12. [Almost every mass extinction in history was caused by a disruption to the carbon-silicate cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxTO2w0fbB4) (Warning: this is an *incredibly* good documentary).  
13. Everything You Care About is just a fucking abstraction of physical laws and quantum fluctuations and will inevitably disappear. This is just a fact.  
14. [Technology use probably causes alexthymia](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/yrewr9/therapist_explains_why_you_dont_feel_anything/) (aka everything feeling numb and emotionally bland). You can actually start feeling emotions again by just touching grass.  
15. [Chytrid fungus](https://www.amphibianark.org/the-crisis/chytrid-fungus/) is fatal to almost every amphibian and is ravaging South America right now. Could gene drive genetic engineering them to secrete antifungal substances through their skin save them? If not, it the next decades few will be an amphibian mass-extinction bloodbath.  
16. [Ramjets but thermonuclear!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bussard_ramjet) Potential application: could a huge ramjet skim the sun's atmosphere, creating a massive fusion explosion and propelling a tiny payload at close to the speed of light?  
17. A combination of basic monkey-at-a-typewriter theorems and the uncertainty principle seem to say that [the universe will after a finite amount of time evolve into any arbitrarily complex configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Stzj2_Rlo4). Could our observed universe just be a random post-heat-death node in an otherwise massive, boiling sea of entropy? Probably not...something something anthropics something...but to be fair, it feels like these principles *guarantee* that even if this *is* the first incarnation of the universe, arbitrarily far in the future it will enter the exact same configuration it's currently in again. I may be misunderstanding this, but it seems like a direct consequence. So even if entropy guaratees we'll all die (which it does unless we can "beat" it), it also guarantees we'll eventually reappear.  
18. Is consciousness informational? Can an upload of your brain be *you*? How high-fidelity would it have to be? Are there degrees of you-ness? Could you be an upload even though you're currently experiening the real world from a real body (kinda complicated, related to an idea I'm calling splinter theory). What's the probability that you're currently a Boltzman brain/a dishbrain being fed ideas by an evil demon? Does consciousness persist from moment to moment? Can we ever know or would the proof be inductive and thus susceptible to evil-demon-MITMing and thus suspicious?
